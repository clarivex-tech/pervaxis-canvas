## Definition of Done

A phase is complete when:

1. All checklist items are checked
2. All new public APIs have JSDoc documentation
3. Unit test coverage is at or above 90% for all new libs
4. All packages build cleanly with zero warnings
5. Changes reviewed and merged to `main` via PR
6. `RELEASE_NOTES.md` updated

## Estimated Effort Reference

| Phase | Estimated Effort |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 — Foundation | 3–5 days |
| Phase 2 — Platform Libraries | 5–7 days |
| Phase 3 — Shell Libraries | 5–7 days |
| Phase 4 — MFE Libraries | 3–4 days |
| Phase 5 — Component Libraries | 10–14 days |
| Phase 6 — Mobile (Ionic) | 7–10 days |
| Phase 7 — Registry Service | 3–4 days |
| Phase 8 — Reference Apps | 5–7 days |
| Phase 9 — Forge Integration | 10–14 days |
| Phase 10 — CI/CD and Publishing | 3–4 days |
| **Total** | **54–76 days** |

Estimates assume one senior full-stack developer. Parallel work across phases reduces wall-clock time significantly.
